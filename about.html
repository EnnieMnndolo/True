    My name is Enson Mndolo, a student at Malawi Universty of Business and Applied Seciences (MUBAS) studying Bachelor of Technical Education Technology (BTECH).
    Since my secondary education, i have been interested in studying Bachelor of Information Technology(IT), Or any other program to do with Computer.
    This has been running in my mind up until when i passed my MSCE. My MSCE being a tool that would offer me an oportunity to either pursue or change the ambition set before, was finally in my hand ready for NCHE.
    I applied for the university, and unfortunately i was not taken into any of the field of my interest but rather they throw me to the field of Education🎓👐 What a tragedy!!
    Without much of interest i began my study on 29th of January, 2022. 
    After few miles of the marathon i was inspired by my fellow student by the name Dalitso Msowoya, who is now my working partener, seeing him doing some coding though studying BTECH(<i>My program</i>).
    Just as you could, i joined him wholeheartedly. 
    By then, i had few basic knowledge of html and css, WEB languages and litle by litle i began to cultivate the litle that i had, up until i trusted my self that i can do something regardless of my program of study*
    Just to cut it short, this App in you hand, is part of my journey in exploring things that the lecturer had never taught me.... 
    Therefore, i would like you to comment on this App so that i get to know areas of improvement and areas to keep them up🤗🤗🤗🤗👣👣 THANK YOU💕
